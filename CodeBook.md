### This file gives a decription of the variables and steps done to clean and organise the data

### Variables
* subject : The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
* train_acc_x : The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'
* train_acc_y : The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer Y axis in standard gravity units 'g'
* train_acc_Z : The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer Z axis in standard gravity units 'g'
* train_body_acc_x : The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration
* train_body_gyro_x : The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second
