# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA - Course project
Thomas Mawora
### Purpose and goal
* Purpose: Demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
* Goal: Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## Submissions to make
* A tidy data set as per given description
* A link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis
* A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data. This is stored in CodeBook.md

## R scripts
Create R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
